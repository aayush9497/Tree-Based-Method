# Tree-Based-Method
In this notebook I have tried to deal with a Highly Imbalanced Dataset and tried to find out the ability of different Machine Algorithms on such datasets.
<b> Algorithms used: </b>
1. Logistic Regression by Upscaling the data.
2.Support Vector Machines
3.Ensemble Learning Method (Random Forest)
